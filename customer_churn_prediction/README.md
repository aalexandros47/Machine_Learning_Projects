# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction

🗂️ A machine learning project that predicts customer churn in a telecom company using real-world-like data.  
The app is built with **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **Streamlit**, and deployed for live use.

---

## 📍 Overview

This project solves a core business problem: **"Which customers are likely to leave?"**  
Using a clean ML pipeline and a user-friendly interface, it allows business teams to:

- 🎯 Enter customer details (age, gender, tenure, monthly charges)
- ⚖️ Get predictions on churn likelihood
- 📊 View churn probabilities interactively

## 🛠️ Features

- 📈 **K-Nearest Neighbors** model with `GridSearchCV`
- 🔍 Real-time prediction with a deployed Streamlit UI
- 🧪 Model and scaler saved as `.pkl` for efficient loading
- 🧹 Clean data preprocessing & EDA in Jupyter Notebook
- 💡 Simple and intuitive UI for business users
