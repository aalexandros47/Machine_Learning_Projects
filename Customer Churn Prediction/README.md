# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) based on their demographic and billing information. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Demo

🔗 [Live Streamlit App](https://your-streamlit-app-link.streamlit.app)  
📂 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction)

## 📊 Project Features

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- 🤖 Machine Learning Model (K-Nearest Neighbors + GridSearchCV)
- 📈 Model Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- 🖥️ Streamlit Web App for real-time prediction
- 💾 Model & Scaler saved with `joblib` for deployment

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- scikit-learn (modeling, preprocessing, metrics)
- Streamlit (interactive frontend)
- Joblib (model serialization)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Data is preprocessed (handling missing values, encoding gender, scaling)
2. Model is trained using `GridSearchCV` to find the best KNN configuration
3. The best model and scaler are saved
4. Streamlit app allows users to enter new customer info and predicts churn probability

## 🛠️ Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```
